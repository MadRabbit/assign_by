AssignBy
========

This plugin extends the ActiveRecord relations functionality and allows you to use
virtual assignments for related units.


Example
=======

Say you've got a user model which has a login field. And a message which belongs to user

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :login
end

class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user, :assign_by => :login
end

specifying the :assign_by => :login option, you create a virtual field 'user_login'
and two methods for it setter and getter.

class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
  
  def user_login
    # .......
  end

  def user_login=(login)
    # .......
  end

end

Now you can use the new field on your forms, and when you put something in it.
Something like

Message.new :user_login => 'Santa'

This will automatically search for a user with login 'Santa', if found the user
will be assigned to the 'user' field, or if not found, there will be a an error
assigned to the 'user_login' field telling that it can't find any relevant records.
